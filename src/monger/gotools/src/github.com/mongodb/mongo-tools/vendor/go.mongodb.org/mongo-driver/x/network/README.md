MongerDB Go Driver Networking Library
====================================
The packages within this library allow users to build applications that speak the MongerDB RPC
protocol. Knowledge of the MongerDB RPC protocol is assumed, so this library mostly contains advanced
features. The aim of this library is to provide an easy to use, high performance implementation of
both the driver and server networking APIs. Combined, these APIs can be used to create a proxy.

This Library's API is experimental and subject to change. Packages may be changed or removed without
notice. These APIs are not stable and do not guarantee backward compatibility.
